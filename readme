📌 Task-02: Library Management System (RESTful API)

A backend-based Library Management System developed as part of **Task-02** for the **CODTECH Internship Program**. This project implements a RESTful API that supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing library books.

👨‍💻 About the Project

This project is designed to demonstrate backend development skills using REST architecture. It provides a clean and modular API to manage library inventory, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete book records.

The application follows industry-standard backend practices, including proper routing, database integration, and separation of concerns. It is suitable for academic submission and backend portfolio demonstration.
